"""Prometheus metrics setup and helpers.

This module defines reusable Prometheus metrics (counters and histograms) and
starts a single HTTP exporter for scraping. It is safe under hot-reload
environments (e.g., Streamlit) via an idempotent server starter.

Notes:
    - Import-time side effect: the exporter is started once if metrics are enabled.
    - Idempotency: helpers return an existing collector if the name is already
      registered; if a different type is found under the same name, we raise.
    - Prometheus client registry is process-global; in multi-process deployments
      use a Pushgateway or ensure only one process exposes the HTTP endpoint.
